Trajectory Prediction - Update Summary  


1. Direction Arrow (Heading / COG)
   - Implemented a red direction arrow (`dl.Polygon`) for each vessel, based on its COG (Course Over Ground).
   - This shows the actual direction the vessel is heading.

2. Trajectory Prediction
   - Added the `predict_trajectory()` function to calculate the future path of each vessel based on:
     - current position (lat, lon)
     - COG direction
     - velocity (knots)
   - Drawn the predicted path using `dl.Polyline` with red lines.
   - Predicts future location for the next 5 minutes.

3. Marker & Popup Enhancements
   - Customized marker colors based on speed (red/orange/blue).
   - Updated popup to include:
     - Vessel name
     - Speed
     - Heading (COG)

4. Interactive Filtering
   - Added dropdown filters:
     - Vessel Name (multi-select)
     - Speed Category (All / Low / Medium / High)
     - Destination (multi-select)
   - Filters dynamically update the map and histogram.


5. Map Integration
   - Built using `dash-leaflet`, supports interactive zoom and popups.
   - The app works inside the browser, no need for Jupyter Notebook.
   - All changes are viewable via the GitLab repo.

Improvements for next week:
- Export `.png` of predicted route using matplotlib
- Real-time data streaming (e.g. via MQTT) for continuous updates
