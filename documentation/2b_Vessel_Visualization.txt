Vessel Visualization Update Summary (April 1, 2025)

Prediction Feature Enhanced

For each vessel, the predicted position 5 minutes later is shown with a green marker.

A dashed arrowed line now connects the current vessel location and the predicted point to visually indicate direction.

Prediction Direction Representation

We initially tried dlx.arrowhead for directional arrows, but due to compatibility and styling issues, we replaced it with a more reliable dashed Polyline + custom arrow style.

This method is simple, clear, and robust across all vessels.

Screenshot Updates

Folder front_end_screenshots/ updated with new UI elements:

vessel_prediction_info.jpg: shows prediction marker and dashed arrow.

Others remain unchanged for navigation, dropdown, and marker hover features.

Note on Implementation
A direct leaflet arrowhead (like ➡️) was not reliable across vessels and zoom levels due to rendering glitches and inconsistencies with projection.
Hence, we chose a dashed line + inline arrow style to clearly show direction without breaking visual flow.
