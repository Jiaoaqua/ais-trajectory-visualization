1.	Topics
At the root of each offered data type is also the topic status. 
The message tells when the data is last updated in epoch seconds. E.g.:
status: {
  "updated" : 1676628995
}

2.	Vessel topics
Topics are constructed like this:
vessels-v2/#                 # Tracking all data
vessels-v2/+/location        # Tracking all locations
vessels-v2/+/metadata        # Tracking all metadata
vessels-v2/<mmsi>/+          # Single vessel locations and metadata
vessels-v2/<mmsi>/location   # Single vessel locations
vessels-v2/<mmsi>/metadata   # Single vessel metadata

Vessel message formats
NOTE: the timestamp in the metadata message is in milliseconds while in the location message it is in seconds.

4. Vessel location -message
{
    "time":1668075025,
    "sog":10.7,
    "cog":326.6,
    "navStat":0,
    "rot":0,

    "raim":false,
    "heading":325,
    "lon":20.345818,
    "lat":60.03802
}

### Message	Description
	time: 1668075025 - the time the location data was recorded, expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch
	sog: 10.7 - 'Speed over ground' This is the vessel's speed relative to the Earth's surface, measured in knots (nautical miles per hour).
	cog: 326.6 - 'Course over ground'. This is the vessel's direction of travel relative to the Earth's surface, measured in degrees.
	navStat: 0 - 'Navigation status'. This is a code defined by the AIS (Automatic Identification System) standard.  You must consult the AIS specifications to determine the exact meaning of "0".  Common values might include "underway using engine," "at anchor," "not under command," etc.
	rot: 0 - 'Rate of turn'. This indicates how quickly the vessel is changing its heading, measured in degrees per minute. A value of 0 means the vessel is not turning.
	posAcc: true - 'Position accuracy'. This boolean value indicates the accuracy of the reported position. true generally means high accuracy (likely from a good GPS fix).
	raim: false - 'Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring'. This indicates whether the GPS data is reliable. false suggests that RAIM is not available or has detected a potential issue with the GPS signal.  This doesn't necessarily mean the position is completely wrong, but it suggests that the system hasn't been able to verify the integrity of the GPS data.
	heading: 325 - 'The vessel's heading'. This is the direction the vessel's bow is pointing, measured in degrees.  It's similar to COG but can differ due to currents, wind, etc.
	lon: 20.345818 - 'Longitude' of the vessel's position.
	lat: 60.03802 - 'Latitude' of the vessel's position.
	
### Interpreting the message: 
	at the given time, 
	the vessel was traveling at 10.7 knots at a course of 326.6 degrees, 
	heading 325 degrees, 
	at a location of approximately 60.03802 
	degrees North latitude and 20.345818 degrees East longitude

SSE topics
Topics are constructed like this:

sse-v2/status
sse-v2/site/<site-id>
Examples of tracking SSE-data
sse-v2/#                       # Tracking all data
sse-v2/status                  # Tracking status messages
sse-v2/site/+                  # Tracking all sites data
sse-v2/site/<site-id>          # Tracking single site data

SSE-data -message
{
    "timestamp":1668085252,
    "seaState":"CALM",
    "trend":"NO_CHANGE",
    "windWaveDir":175,
    "confidence":"GOOD",
    "heelAngle":3,
    "lightStatus":"OFF",
    "temperature":10
}
### Message	Description
	timestamp: 1668085252 - The time the SSE data was recorded, expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).  You'll need to convert this to a human-readable date and time.
	seaState: "CALM" - A description of the overall sea state at the location. In this case, it's "CALM". Other possible values could be "ROUGH," "MODERATE," etc., but the specific vocabulary used by Digitraffic should be confirmed from their documentation.
	trend: "NO_CHANGE" - Indicates the trend of the sea state. Here, it's "NO_CHANGE," meaning the conditions are stable. Other possibilities might be "IMPROVING," "WORSENING," etc.
	windWaveDir: 175 - The direction from which wind waves are coming, measured in degrees. 0 degrees is North, 90 degrees is East, and so on. So, wind waves are coming from a direction close to South (180 degrees).
	confidence: "GOOD" - Indicates the confidence level in the accuracy of the reported SSE data.  "GOOD" suggests a high degree of reliability. Other values could be "MEDIUM," "LOW," etc.
	heelAngle: 3 -  The angle of heel (tilt) of a vessel (or perhaps a buoy or platform at the measurement site), measured in degrees. A heel angle of 3 degrees suggests a slight tilt.  If this data comes from a shore-based sensor, it might refer to some other tilting aspect of the measuring equipment.  The context should make it clear.
	lightStatus: "OFF" - The status of a light at the measurement site.  In this case, it's "OFF." This is likely relevant if the data is coming from a buoy or navigational aid.
	temperature: 10 - The water temperature at the measurement site, likely in degrees Celsius.

### Interpreting the message:
	this message indicates that at the given timestamp, 
	the sea state at the monitored location was calm, 
	with no change in the trend, 
	wind waves coming from approximately South, 
	a good level of confidence in the data, a slight heel angle (if applicable), 
	a light that was off, 
	and a water temperature of 10 degrees Celsius.
